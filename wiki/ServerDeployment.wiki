#summary Deploying the Server - notes

Deploying the server requires PHP5 and MySQL (use {{{database.sql}}}).

The folder "uclient" contains the code to process the HTTP request from the DynDNS client requesting an update of IP address.

The rest of the code deals the web interface. Edit config.php to change various options.

Database.sql is the mysql database.
